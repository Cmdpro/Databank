1. Databank should never intentionally mess with the vanilla game unless another mod tells it to in some way
2. Vanilla bug fixes are included in the previous entry
3. Databank is allowed to basically have almost anything as long as its useful to development of mods which wish to use it

if more is thought of, ill add it here

the purpose of these is mainly so that even if i provide no input, databank doesn't go outside what I wish for it to, anything that doesnt violate any of these should be assumed to be fine though
